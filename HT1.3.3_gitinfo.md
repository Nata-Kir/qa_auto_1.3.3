# **Useful info about GIT**
The *git reset*, *git checkout*, and *git revert* commands are some of the most useful tools in your Git toolbox.
## **Git revert**
A revert operation will take the specified commit, inverse the changes from that commit, and create a new "revert commit". The ref pointers are then updated to point at the new revert commit making it the tip of the branch.
It's important to understand that git revert undoes a single commitâ€”it does not "revert" back to the previous state of a project by removing all subsequent commits. In Git, this is actually called a reset, not a revert.
## **Git reset**
The git reset command is a complex and versatile tool for undoing changes. It has three primary forms of invocation, correspond to command line arguments --soft, --mixed, --hard.
Git reset, moves both the HEAD and branch refs to the specified commit.
The ref pointer modification always happens and is an update to the third tree, the Commit tree. 
## **Git checkout**
The git checkout command operates upon three distinct entities: files, commits, and branches.
